# Source structure

- To execute whole program, run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This file will scan all input-files in folder `./INPUT/`, consequently implement `usc`, `ids`, `aStartSearch`, `gbfs` algorithms and write the coressponding out-files to folder `./OUTPUT/`

- All algorithms are implemented in folder `SOURCE/algorithms/`
- Utilities and helper functions (such as logic of calculating heuristis, input graph )
